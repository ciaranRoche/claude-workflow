**Date**: 2025-08-01T18:45:27Z  
**Phase**: Discovery Complete  
**Total Questions**: 5/5 Answered

All discovery questions have been answered. These responses will guide the detailed technical requirements and architecture design.

---

## Question 1: Plex Server Integration Scope
**Answer**: ✅ **CONFIRMED - Core media discovery and playback control**

**Agreed Scope**:
- Media library browsing (movies, TV shows, music, photos)
- Search functionality across all media types
- Playback control (play, pause, stop, seek) for active sessions
- Basic metadata retrieval (title, description, cast, ratings)

**Implementation Impact**: Focus on essential MCP tools for media interaction, defer advanced features like library management and user administration.

---

## Question 2: Target MCP Client Applications
**Answer**: ✅ **CONFIRMED - Personal AI assistant integration with chatbot focus**

**Agreed Target**:
- Voice/text commands for media control ("play the latest episode of...", "find movies with...")
- Intelligent media recommendations based on viewing history
- Natural language queries for media discovery
- **Primary Focus**: Chatbot integration

**Implementation Impact**: Optimize MCP tool descriptions and response formats for conversational AI interfaces. Design for natural language interaction patterns.

## Question 3: Authentication and Multi-User Support
**Answer**: ✅ **MODIFIED - No authentication needed**

**Agreed Approach**:
- Personal use only - no authentication complexity
- Direct Plex server connection without user switching
- Single user context (owner/admin level access)

**Implementation Impact**: Significantly simplified architecture - no OAuth, no user management, no token handling complexity. Direct Plex API integration.

---

## Question 4: Deployment Architecture and Scalability
**Answer**: ✅ **CONFIRMED - Single Docker container for k3s**

**Agreed Architecture**:
- Docker container optimized for k3s deployment
- Single Plex server connection with automatic reconnection
- Resource limits appropriate for home server hardware
- Health checks and graceful shutdown handling
- Configuration via environment variables

**Implementation Impact**: Container-first design with k3s manifests, environment-driven configuration, health endpoint implementation.

---

## Question 5: Performance and Resource Constraints
**Answer**: ✅ **CONFIRMED - Lightweight proxy with smart caching**

**Agreed Performance Profile**:
- Minimal memory footprint (< 100MB typical usage)
- HTTP connection pooling to Plex server
- Metadata caching with configurable TTL (default 5 minutes)
- No persistent storage requirements beyond configuration
- Graceful degradation when Plex server unavailable

**Implementation Impact**: Cache-enabled architecture, connection pooling, in-memory storage only, resource-conscious design patterns.

## Requirements Summary

Based on the discovery answers, the Plex MCP server will be:

### **Core Characteristics**
- **Purpose**: Personal chatbot integration for Plex media control
- **Scope**: Media discovery and playback control only
- **Authentication**: None required (personal use)
- **Deployment**: Docker container on k3s
- **Performance**: Lightweight with intelligent caching

### **Key Design Decisions**
1. **Simplified Architecture**: No authentication removes significant complexity
2. **Focused Feature Set**: Core media functions only, extensible design for future features
3. **Chatbot Optimized**: Tool descriptions and responses designed for conversational AI
4. **Home-Lab Ready**: Resource-conscious, k3s-deployable, environment-configured
5. **Reliable Operation**: Caching, connection pooling, graceful degradation

### **Next Phase**
Proceed to expert-level technical questions to define:
- Specific MCP tool implementations
- API integration patterns
- Error handling strategies
- Configuration management
- Deployment specifications
