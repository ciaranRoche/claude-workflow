# Discovery Questions: Plex MCP Server

**Date**: 2025-08-01T18:45:27Z  
**Phase**: Discovery  
**Total Questions**: 5

Based on the comprehensive MCP and Plex API research, these questions will clarify the specific requirements and scope for the Plex MCP server implementation.

## Question 1: Plex Server Integration Scope

**Question**: Which Plex Media Server capabilities should the MCP server expose to AI agents?

**Context**: Plex offers extensive functionality including media discovery, playback control, user management, library management, metadata handling, and statistics. The scope determines both complexity and usefulness.

**Smart Default**: **Core media discovery and playback control**
- Media library browsing (movies, TV shows, music, photos)
- Search functionality across all media types
- Playback control (play, pause, stop, seek) for active sessions
- Basic metadata retrieval (title, description, cast, ratings)

**Reasoning**: This covers the most common AI agent use cases for media interaction while keeping initial complexity manageable. Advanced features like user management or server administration can be added in later iterations.

## Question 2: Target MCP Client Applications

**Question**: What types of AI applications and use cases will primarily interact with this Plex MCP server?

**Context**: Different client applications have varying needs - chatbots need conversational media recommendations, automation systems need programmatic control, and media management tools need comprehensive metadata access.

**Smart Default**: **Personal AI assistant integration (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT)**
- Voice/text commands for media control ("play the latest episode of...", "find movies with...")
- Intelligent media recommendations based on viewing history
- Natural language queries for media discovery
- Home automation integration for smart home setups

**Reasoning**: Personal AI assistants represent the primary MCP ecosystem growth area and align with the home-lab project context. This use case drives the most valuable features while maintaining focused scope.

## Question 3: Authentication and Multi-User Support

**Question**: Should the MCP server support multiple Plex users and what authentication model should be used?

**Context**: Plex supports multiple users with different permissions and viewing preferences. The MCP server could operate as a single admin user or support per-user authentication with individual permissions.

**Smart Default**: **Single admin user with user impersonation capabilities**
- MCP server authenticates with Plex admin token
- AI agents can specify target user for personalized recommendations
- User switching via MCP tool parameters rather than authentication
- Simplified deployment and token management

**Reasoning**: This approach balances functionality with operational simplicity. Most home-lab scenarios involve trusted AI agents where the complexity of per-user OAuth isn't justified, while still enabling personalized experiences.

## Question 4: Deployment Architecture and Scalability

**Question**: How should the MCP server be deployed and what scalability requirements should guide the architecture?

**Context**: Options range from single Docker container for one Plex server to horizontally scalable architecture supporting multiple Plex instances with load balancing and high availability.

**Smart Default**: **Single Docker container for home-lab deployment**
- Docker container optimized for k3s deployment
- Single Plex server connection with automatic reconnection
- Resource limits appropriate for home server hardware
- Health checks and graceful shutdown handling
- Configuration via environment variables

**Reasoning**: Matches the home-lab k3s environment mentioned in the project context. Most home users have a single Plex server, making multi-instance complexity unnecessary. Container approach enables easy deployment and updates.

## Question 5: Performance and Resource Constraints

**Question**: What performance characteristics and resource constraints should guide the implementation choices?

**Context**: MCP servers can be lightweight proxies or include caching, background processing, and intelligent prefetching. Resource usage affects deployment options and operational costs.

**Smart Default**: **Lightweight proxy with smart caching**
- Minimal memory footprint (< 100MB typical usage)
- HTTP connection pooling to Plex server
- Metadata caching with configurable TTL (default 5 minutes)
- No persistent storage requirements beyond configuration
- Graceful degradation when Plex server unavailable

**Reasoning**: Home-lab environments often have resource constraints. A lightweight approach ensures the MCP server doesn't compete with Plex itself for resources, while intelligent caching reduces API load and improves response times for AI agents.

## Summary of Smart Defaults

The research-based defaults create a **focused, production-ready Plex MCP server** that:

1. **Core Focus**: Media discovery and playback control
2. **Target Use Case**: Personal AI assistant integration
3. **Authentication**: Admin-level with user impersonation
4. **Deployment**: Single Docker container for k3s
5. **Performance**: Lightweight with intelligent caching

This approach balances functionality, complexity, and operational requirements for a successful home-lab implementation while providing a foundation for future enhancements.
