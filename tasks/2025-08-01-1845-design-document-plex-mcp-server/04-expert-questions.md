# Expert Technical Questions: Plex MCP Server

**Date**: 2025-08-01T18:45:27Z  
**Phase**: Expert Technical Requirements  
**Total Questions**: 5

Based on the discovery answers and MCP research, these expert-level questions will define the specific technical implementation details for your personal Plex MCP server.

## Question 1: MCP Tool Architecture and Granularity

**Question**: How granular should the MCP tools be for optimal chatbot interaction?

**Context**: MCP tools can be designed as high-level composite operations ("find_and_play_movie") or atomic operations ("search_movies" + "play_media"). Research shows chatbots perform better with clear, focused tool descriptions.

**Smart Default**: **Atomic tools with clear purposes**
- `search_media` - Search across all media types with filters
- `get_media_details` - Retrieve detailed metadata for specific items
- `list_libraries` - Get available Plex libraries
- `get_playback_status` - Check current playback sessions
- `control_playback` - Play/pause/stop/seek operations
- `get_recently_added` - Fetch newly added content
- `get_on_deck` - Get continue watching / up next items

**Reasoning**: Atomic tools give chatbots flexibility to combine operations naturally. Clear single-purpose tools reduce confusion and improve AI agent decision-making based on MCP best practices research.

## Question 2: Technology Stack and MCP Transport Selection

**Question**: Which specific technology stack should be used for the implementation?

**Context**: Research shows TypeScript offers the best modern MCP development experience with Streamable HTTP transport. Python has broader ecosystem support but slightly more overhead.

**Smart Default**: **TypeScript with modern MCP stack**
- **Language**: TypeScript (Node.js runtime)
- **MCP SDK**: @anthropic-ai/sdk (official Anthropic TypeScript SDK)
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP (latest 2025 standard)
- **Plex Integration**: @lukehagar/plexjs (modern Speakeasy-generated SDK)
- **Container**: Node.js Alpine-based Docker image
- **Configuration**: Environment variables with Zod validation

**Reasoning**: TypeScript provides excellent MCP tooling, type safety for Plex API integration, and aligns with modern cloud-native patterns. The Streamable HTTP transport is production-ready and cloud-deployable.

## Question 3: Caching Strategy and Data Management

**Question**: What specific caching approach should be implemented for optimal performance?

**Context**: Home-lab environments benefit from intelligent caching to reduce Plex server load, but cache invalidation complexity must be balanced against benefits.

**Smart Default**: **In-memory LRU cache with intelligent TTL**
- **Library metadata**: 15-minute TTL (changes infrequently)
- **Search results**: 5-minute TTL (balance freshness vs performance)
- **Playback status**: 30-second TTL (near real-time updates needed)
- **Recently added**: 2-minute TTL (users expect quick visibility)
- **Cache size**: 100MB limit with LRU eviction
- **Cache warming**: Pre-load libraries and recent content on startup

**Reasoning**: Different data types have different freshness requirements. In-memory approach avoids persistence complexity while providing meaningful performance gains for chatbot interactions.

## Question 4: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

**Question**: How should the MCP server handle Plex server connectivity issues and errors?

**Context**: Home-lab Plex servers may restart, go offline, or have network issues. MCP clients expect graceful degradation and clear error messages.

**Smart Default**: **Graceful degradation with informative errors**
- **Connection retry**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, max 30s)
- **Health checks**: Periodic Plex server ping every 60 seconds
- **Cache fallback**: Return cached data with staleness warning when server unavailable
- **Error responses**: Clear, actionable MCP error messages for chatbots
- **Circuit breaker**: Temporarily skip server calls after repeated failures
- **Graceful startup**: Wait for Plex connectivity before accepting MCP requests

**Reasoning**: Home-lab environments need robust error handling. Clear error messages help chatbots inform users about issues. Cache fallback maintains limited functionality during outages.

## Question 5: Configuration and Deployment Specifics

**Question**: What specific configuration and deployment approach should be implemented for k3s?

**Context**: k3s deployment requires specific considerations for service discovery, secrets management, and resource constraints in home-lab environments.

**Smart Default**: **k3s-optimized deployment with ConfigMap/Secret pattern**
- **Configuration**: ConfigMap for non-sensitive settings, Secret for Plex server URL/credentials
- **Service**: ClusterIP with optional Ingress for external MCP client access
- **Resources**: 50Mi memory request, 100Mi limit, 100m CPU request, 200m limit
- **Health checks**: Readiness and liveness probes on `/health` endpoint
- **Auto-restart**: Always restart policy with exponential backoff
- **Namespace**: Dedicated namespace (e.g., `media-services`)
- **Image**: Multi-stage build with distroless final image for security

**Reasoning**: Follows k3s best practices with appropriate resource limits for home-lab hardware. Separate namespace provides isolation. Health checks ensure reliable operation.
