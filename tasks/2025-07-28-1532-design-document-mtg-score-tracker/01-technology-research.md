- **Consideration**: Newer ecosystem, fewer gaming-specific libraries

### Database Strategy
**Primary Database: PostgreSQL 16**
- **Rationale**: Battle-tested for complex gaming data relationships
- **Benefits**:
  - ACID compliance for match integrity
  - JSON columns for flexible deck data
  - Excellent k3s deployment options via operators
  - Strong analytics capabilities for game history

**Caching Layer: Redis 7**
- **Rationale**: Industry standard for gaming applications in 2025
- **Benefits**:
  - Real-time leaderboards
  - Session storage
  - Live match state caching
  - Sub-millisecond latency

**Alternative: MongoDB Atlas**
- **Rationale**: Document model fits gaming data patterns
- **Benefits**: Flexible schema for deck variations, built-in analytics
- **Trade-off**: Less ACID compliance, potential data consistency issues

### Real-Time Communication
**Primary Recommendation: WebSockets with Socket.io**
- **Rationale**: MTG score tracking requires bidirectional real-time communication
- **Benefits**:
  - Live score updates from all players
  - Real-time match state synchronization
  - Automatic reconnection handling
  - Room-based match organization

**Fallback: Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
- **Use Case**: Read-only updates (match results, leaderboards)
- **Benefits**: Simpler implementation, automatic reconnection
- **Limitation**: Unidirectional communication only

### Authentication & Authorization
**Primary Recommendation: Firebase Authentication**
- **Rationale**: Google's official solution with seamless OAuth integration
- **Benefits**:
  - One-click Google sign-in
  - Handles OAuth 2.0 complexity
  - Built-in security best practices
  - Zero-config integration
  - Compliant with 2025 Google security requirements

**Alternative: Auth0**
- **Benefits**: Multi-provider support, advanced features
- **Trade-off**: Additional cost, more complex setup

### Deployment & Infrastructure
**Container Strategy: Docker with Multi-stage Builds**
- **Frontend**: Nginx serving static files with Node.js for SSR
- **Backend**: Slim Node.js Alpine image
- **Database**: Official PostgreSQL and Redis images

**k3s Deployment Best Practices**:
- **Namespace Strategy**: Separate dev/staging/prod environments
- **Resource Management**: CPU/memory limits for predictable performance
- **Service Mesh**: Consider Istio for advanced traffic management
- **Persistent Storage**: Use k3s local-path provisioner for development

### Supporting Technologies

**State Management (Frontend)**
- **React**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **Vue**: Pinia
- **Rationale**: Simple, predictable state for match/game data

**API Architecture**
- **Primary**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specification
- **Real-time**: WebSocket events for live updates
- **GraphQL**: Consider for complex data fetching patterns

**Testing Strategy**
- **Unit**: Jest/Vitest for logic testing
- **Integration**: Cypress for end-to-end user flows
- **Load**: Artillery for WebSocket performance testing

**Monitoring & Observability**
- **Application**: OpenTelemetry with Jaeger
- **Infrastructure**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for production monitoring

## Architecture Considerations

### Microservices vs Monolith
**Recommendation: Modular Monolith Initially**
- **Rationale**: Easier k3s deployment, faster development for MVP
- **Migration Path**: Clear module boundaries for future microservices extraction
- **Services to Extract Later**: User management, match engine, notifications

### Data Consistency
**Match State Management**:
- Use Redis for live match state
- PostgreSQL for persistent game history
- Event sourcing pattern for match progression
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous score updates

### Security Considerations
**WebSocket Security**:
- WSS (WebSocket Secure) protocols mandatory
- Origin validation and CORS configuration
- JWT token validation for WebSocket connections
- Rate limiting for API and WebSocket events

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend
- Code splitting by route/feature
- Image optimization for deck/card images
- Service worker for offline capability
- Lazy loading for game history

### Backend
- Connection pooling for database
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- WebSocket connection management
- Horizontal scaling readiness

### Database
- Proper indexing for match queries
- Partitioning for historical data
- Read replicas for analytics
- Connection pooling with PgBouncer

## Development Experience

### DevOps Pipeline
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with k3s deployment
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose for full stack
- **Testing**: Automated testing pipeline
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for production issues

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across stack
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier for consistency
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI specs + code comments
- **Version Control**: Conventional commits + semantic versioning

## Cost Considerations

### Development Costs
- Open source stack minimizes licensing
- Firebase Auth free tier generous for MVP
- k3s reduces infrastructure overhead

### Operational Costs
- PostgreSQL and Redis can run on modest k3s resources
- CDN for static assets (Cloudflare)
- Monitoring with open source tools

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **WebSocket Scaling**: Plan for horizontal scaling early
- **Data Consistency**: Test concurrent match updates thoroughly
- **k3s Complexity**: Have disaster recovery procedures
- **Authentication Dependency**: Firebase vendor lock-in consideration

### Mitigation Strategies
- Load testing for WebSocket performance
- Database transaction testing
- k3s backup and restore procedures
- Authentication abstraction layer for portability

## Conclusion

This technology stack balances modern best practices with practical deployment requirements. The emphasis on real-time capabilities, easy authentication, and k3s optimization provides a solid foundation for building a scalable MTG score tracker that users will find intuitive and reliable.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to detailed requirements gathering through discovery questions to validate these technology choices against specific user needs and constraints.
