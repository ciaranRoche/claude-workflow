## User Request

I want to build a full stack app, the idea of the app is to have a score tracker for magic the gathering. The app should accept users, users should be able to store their deck games, join matches, and we should persist a history of all games and their results.

- Commander format Magic: The Gathering

- Historical game review with deck information
- Comments visible for result analysis

### Technical Requirements

- Comments are persisted for future reference
- Users can review:
