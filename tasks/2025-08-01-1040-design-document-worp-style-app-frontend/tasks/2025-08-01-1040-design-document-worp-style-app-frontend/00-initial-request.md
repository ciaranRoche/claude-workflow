# Initial Request: WORP Style App Frontend Design Document

## Original User Request

**Date**: 2025-08-01T10:40:00Z  
**Project**: home-lab  
**Feature**: WORP style app frontend improvements

## Request Details

The user wants to update the WORP style app in home-lab with specific frontend styling requirements:

### Font Requirements
- A monospace, retro font (like VT323) is used for all text to mimic old computer terminals

### Color Requirements
- The color palette is strictly black (#000000) and neon green (#00ff00)

### Visual Effects Requirements
1. **Typing Animation**: Text appears progressively, creating a classic typewriter effect
2. **Blinking Cursor**: The cursor at the user prompt blinks on and off
3. **CRT Filter**: Subtle visual effects that simulate a CRT monitor, including:
   - Scanline overlay
   - Slight flicker effect

## Analysis Directive

The user specifically requested to "ultrathink and review the current implementation to the front end of the app" - indicating a need for:
- Deep analysis of existing frontend implementation
- Understanding current architecture and patterns
- Comprehensive review of what needs to be changed vs. what can be enhanced
- Technical assessment of how to implement the retro terminal effects

## Context
This appears to be part of a home lab setup, suggesting the WORP app is likely a self-hosted application running in the user's K3s cluster environment.

## Next Steps
1. Analyze existing WORP app frontend implementation
2. Understand current technology stack and architecture
3. Define specific requirements for implementing the retro terminal styling
4. Create detailed design document for the frontend improvements
