# Expert Question Answers: WOPR Display Technical Implementation

## Question 1: Typewriter Animation Synchronization Strategy
**Answer**: Extend carousel timing dynamically based on content length - wait for typing completion before rotating, with a maximum 15-second timeout to prevent indefinite delays on long content.

## Question 2: WebSocket Update Handling During Animations  
**Answer**: Queue new data and allow current animations to complete - do not interrupt in-progress typing animations. This prioritizes smooth visual experience over real-time data updates since this is a pleasing visual display rather than critical operational monitoring.

## Question 3: CRT Scanline Implementation Approach
**Answer**: Use CSS `::before` pseudo-element with repeating linear gradient for performance, with subtle vertical scrolling animation (5-10 second cycle) to simulate authentic CRT phosphor persistence.

## Question 4: Multi-Section Typing Coordination
**Answer**: Only animate the currently visible section to optimize performance, pre-render invisible sections instantly, then apply typing animation when they become visible during carousel rotation.

## Question 5: Terminal Footer Integration with Fixed Layout
**Answer**: Reduce main content area to 280px height and add 30px terminal footer, maintaining the total 400px display height while ensuring all content remains fully visible within the fixed touchscreen dimensions.

## Implementation Summary
- **Visual Experience Priority**: Smooth animations over real-time updates
- **Performance Optimization**: Single-section animation + hardware-accelerated CSS
- **Authentic CRT Effects**: Scrolling scanlines with CSS gradients
- **Layout Preservation**: Proportional height reduction to accommodate terminal footer
- **Hardware Consideration**: ARM64-optimized approach for Raspberry Pi deployment
