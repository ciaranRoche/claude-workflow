# Expert Consultation Responses

**Consultation Date**: 2025-07-28T19:47:00Z  
**Stakeholder**: User  
**Questions Completed**: 1 of 7

---

## Question 1: WebSocket Scaling Strategy Priority

**Decision**: **Option A - Implement Scaling Immediately** ✅

**Stakeholder Response**: "implement scaling immediately"

**Implementation Notes**:
- Add Redis sharded adapter configuration before MVP
- Configure k3s Ingress with sticky sessions (sessionAffinity: ClientIP)
- Implement connection recovery logic with exponential backoff
- Timeline adjustment: +1-2 weeks to development schedule

**Priority**: **Critical** - This decision enables proper k3s multi-instance deployment from day one

---

## Question 2: Database Performance vs. Complexity Trade-off

**Decision**: **Option C - Simple Configuration** ✅

**Stakeholder Response**: "go with option c, the app will not be under major load"

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use application-level connection pooling (built into Node.js pg library)
- Implement basic Redis caching with cache-aside pattern
- Focus on essential indexes for core queries
- Keep k3s resource allocation flexible for potential increases if needed

**Priority**: **Low-Medium** - Appropriate complexity for friend group scale, can optimize later if growth occurs

---

## Question 3: PWA vs. Native Mobile Experience

**Decision**: **Option B - Mobile-Optimized Web App** ✅

**Stakeholder Response**: "go with a mobile optimized web app"

**Implementation Notes**:
- Focus on responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Implement touch optimization (44px minimum touch targets)
- Add basic caching for offline tolerance (but not full offline mode)
- Ensure smooth experience across devices without PWA complexity

**Priority**: **Medium** - Maintains development simplicity while ensuring good mobile experience for in-person gaming

---

## Question 4: Security vs. Usability Balance

**Decision**: **Option B - Balanced Security** ✅

**Stakeholder Response**: "option b sounds good"

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implement essential rate limiting (Redis-based, per-IP and per-user limits)
- Keep Firebase as primary auth with basic input validation
- Add security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Focus on transparent security that doesn't impact user experience

**Priority**: **Medium** - Provides good protection while maintaining smooth friend group experience

---

## Question 5: Real-Time Architecture Sophistication

**Decision**: **Option B - Enhanced Optimistic Updates** ✅

**Stakeholder Response**: "option b"

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implement improved conflict resolution with timestamp-based validation
- Add comprehensive rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- Create basic event logging for debugging (not full event sourcing)
- Include connection recovery with state synchronization

**Priority**: **Medium-High** - Provides good reliability insurance for real-time gaming without architectural complexity

---

## Question 6: Data Persistence and Privacy Strategy

**Decision**: **Option A - Comprehensive Data Retention** ✅

**Stakeholder Response**: "store indefinitely, we are using self hosted postgres so cost is not an issue"

**Implementation Notes**:
- Store all game data indefinitely (match results, events, personal notes, deck performance)
- Implement comprehensive export tools (CSV, JSON formats)
- Create detailed analytics dashboard for long-term performance tracking
- Design granular privacy controls for sharing within friend groups
- Plan for database growth with proper indexing strategies

**Priority**: **Medium** - Provides maximum user value for game analysis and improvement without cost constraints

---

## Question 7: Deployment and Operations Complexity

**Decision**: **Option A - Full k3s Production Setup** ✅

**Stakeholder Response**: "option A want to use this as a learning experience"

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implement complete Kubernetes deployment with HPA, monitoring, service mesh
- Include comprehensive observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Set up proper CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Create production-grade security policies and network policies
- Document all operational procedures for learning reference

**Priority**: **High** - Provides excellent learning opportunity with production-grade infrastructure

---
